*Ride Cancellation and Rating Analysis*

In this project, I performed an exploratory analysis of the dataset to understand ride cancellation reasons and to check whether the rating data aligns with reality.

1. *Cancellation Analysis*

I filtered out non-applicable values and calculated the percentage of cancellations for both customers and drivers.

I created horizontal bar plots and a side-by-side comparative chart to visualize differences between customer and driver perspectives.

For example, “Wrong address” accounted for ~22% of customer cancellations, while drivers reported ~26% as “Customer related issue,” showing differences in perception for the same event.

2. *Comparison with Ratings*

I examined the rating columns (Driver Ratings and Customer Ratings) to assess consistency with cancellations.

The analysis revealed that all ratings were fixed (4.3 for drivers and 4.5 for customers), indicating that ratings do not reflect actual performance.

3. *Insights*

The analysis of cancellation reasons revealed important perceptual gaps between drivers and customers, which can help improve communication and operational processes.

Even without reliable ratings, the cancellation data provides consistent and meaningful insights into user behavior.

4 *Conclusion*

This project highlights the importance of good data quality and the need for more reliable rating systems to accurately reflect user experiences.
